	personal work data.

Google Drive, Dropbox
	shared work data


Switch tools as needed based on circumstance. For example, my personal work notes are in org-mode, academic papers are in Zotero, personal work data is in a git + git-annex repo, and shared work notes and data are spread between Google Drive, Dropbox, and a private file server, depending on the requirements of the other people involved. I also have personal life notes in org-mode, Simplenote, and some ancient notes still to be migrated from Evernote. Hyperlinks tie files together as needed.
